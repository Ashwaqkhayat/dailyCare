Health tracking apps became widely used in the last century, they help people to maintain a better and healthier lifestyle effortlessly without affecting their work/social life. Even though these apps or on hand for everybody, they are still hard for the elderly to use, which is why we are introducing you to DailyCare.
DailyCare is a Client-Server based system that keeps track of main health measurement: body temperature, heart rate, and oxygen level through 3 wearable sensors that senses and sends data automatically without any human intervention which is suitable for elderly users.The system connects the elderly to their medical services in seconds without any personal communication needed.
DailyCare provides two interfaces: 1) The elder user application interface, and 2) The Medical server interface, which allows any authorized user to view their data. It does not stop here!! Dailycare systems provide several types of warnings and notifications to both medical servers and elder users based on the patient data to ease and speed the process of providing the help the patient needs.
